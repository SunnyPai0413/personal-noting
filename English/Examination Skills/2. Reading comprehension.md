	 2. main idea is usually at the beginning of the paragraph

 3. Do the tests after knowing the idea
	 1. Read the questions and classify them, then find the answers in the passage
	 2. main idea questions: already found
	3. detail questions: locate the paragraph, then sentence, and have the answer
		never forget about the main idea, and answer what the writer thought
	4. source/topic selecting questions: if having problems between selections, use reverse thinking
